## General Info
I built this web app to help me and my wife track our newborn's sleep, eating, and pooping patterns through the days, weeks, and months. It has been surprisingly helpful to see poo trends, remember how long it's been since baby's last nap, and remember which side she fed on last. The web app is built Plotly Dash
