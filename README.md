## General Info
I built this web app to help me and my wife track our newborn's sleep, eating, and pooping patterns through the days, weeks, and months. It has been surprisingly helpful to see poo trends, remember how long it's been since baby's last nap, and remember which side she fed on last. The web app is built using [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) which is a great open source tool for quickly creating web apps in nothing but Python!

There are 3 tabs in the app: 
* The "Input" tab is where you input details about an event.

* The "History" tab shows an editable table with the last 200 events. Here events can be modified or deleted.

* The "Analytics" tab currently shows an interactive Gantt chart of the last 7 days of events, but you could add tons of other things here with a little bit of editing.
